# Data Analysis of best selling books dataset
I performed a comprehensive data analysis of the _best-selling books_ dataset (a dataset from Kaggle) to extract meaningful insights and inform data-driven decisions. Sharing insights derived from the data analysis:

**Tools used**: 
* Jupyter Notebook (Code and Markdown)
* Draw.io (To create flowchart)
## Summary of the project
* **Data cleaning**: Performed data cleaning, handling missing values, and addressing data anomalies to prepare the dataset for analysis. 
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  * Performed preliminary data analysis to discover valuable information regarding book sales patterns.
  * Used data visualization methods to identify essential attributes, including book title, author, genre, publication year, and metrics related to sales.
* **Top-selling authors** : Identified the authors with the highest number of best-selling books. J.K.Rowling emerged as the top-selling author with 500 million sales of his books.
* **Top-selling books**: Identified the books with the most extensive record of best-sellers. "A Tale of Two Cities" stood out as the top performer, boasting 200 million in sales.
* **Genre Analysis**: Determined which genre performs better in terms of sales. The Fantasy genre outperforms other genres in terms of sales.
* **Sales distribution by language**: Investigated the distribution of sales in percentage by language. The books categorized under the English language consistently achieve the highest sales figures.
* **Sales Analysis**: Explored the metrics related to sales, such as total sales by book and genre.
* **Correlation Analysis**: Examined correlations between Sales and Year. The approximate sales range falls between 22 and 50 million units. Sales remained consistently high from 1950 to 2000.
* **Visualization**: Used data visualization techniques, such as bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and pie charts, to present findings effectively.
## Python functions and features
I used the following Python functions and features for data analysis:
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning. The key functions include `read_csv` (for loading the dataset), `head` (for viewing the first few rows), and functions for filtering, aggregating, and transforming data.
* **NumPy**: For calculations and statistical analysis of the data.
* **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization. Created various types of plots, such as bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, pie charts, and line charts to visualize trends and patterns in the data.
* **Regular Expressions (re module)**: For removing multiple random characters from book titles. 
* **Apply Functions (Pandas)**: For applying custom functions to the Book column.
* **GroupBy (Pandas)**: For aggregating and summarizing data, such as finding the total sales per genre or author.
